## Install

Our code is mostly shared as R scipts, primarily developed with the 4.1.0 release. The exception are scripts for comparing proportions of cells which uses the [speckle](https://github.com/phipsonlab/speckle) package and requires a newer version of R - we used R 4.2.3. 


## Data availability
The Seurat and Scanpy objects for single-cell data, along with a CSV file containing coordinates and cell types for all single cells, have been deposited in Zenodo under the DOI: https://doi.org/ 10.5281/zenodo.13901180.  The original IMC image data and the image of tissue regions with pathologist annotations has also been uploaded to Zenodo under the same DOI. All H&E images can be downloaded from [!https://dna-discovery.stanford.edu/publicmaterial/datasets/spatial_CRC/].  All these files are publicly accessible as of the publication date.
